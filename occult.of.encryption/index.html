                        Occult of Encryption is a publication//visual essay on the modalities
                        of interaction with AI and data safeguarding techniques.
                        Through its discourse, the work investigates the critical climate of data safety
                        in regards to usage of generative AI. Testing and expanding the framework of
                        Data Trust, the project aims to encourage the readers to reflect on usage of AI in
                        relation to their own creativity, as well as the creativity of others.
                        By fostering exploration, the work aims to reshape how AI is perceived and
                        integrated, highlighting {ethical considerations + its potential as a creative tool}.

                        <p> Technology’s exponential integration into modern life has transformed it from
                            an optional tool into an essential infrastructure. What once was framed as
                            innovation of convenience, now is firmly embedded into the contemporary
                            technological rituals of the modern society.
                            Society and computation, both shaping and being shaped by one
                            another, blur the boundaries of influence to such an extent that it becomes
                            difficult to discern where necessity ends and manufactured demand begins.
                        </p>

                        <p> Contemporary design transcends the isolated mediums, extending into meta-
                            forms of crafting networks, systems, interfaces and even ourselves. Arguably,
                            there is no longer an “outside” to design—the world itself has been designed.
                            In the data-dialogue, interaction modalities {interfaces} thus becomes the
                            mediums turning the temporal experience into narrative devices. Through such
                            paradigm, the digital footprints are not just byproducts of interaction but the
                            very driver or a condition of initiated variable.
                            From this landscape emerges datafication - paradigm in which the
                            interactions with the interfaces generate data which is being gathered and
                            processed:

                        <p>With the release of Public AI, the discourse around data complicates further.
                            LLMS and GenAI rely on vast datasets for training and for calibration.
                            Billions of imagery scraped all over internet - traces of our collective digital
                            footprint are ingrained into these models. The commofified nature of these
                            models enforces the opaque modality of ineractions - we engage with the
                            outputs of such without insight into underlying processes that shape them.
                            Illustrated in the diagram below, the modality of interaction has an
                            ambiguous input, a concealed process, and a visible output.
                        </p>
                        <p> As practitioners exploring the role of generative AI, it is essential to reject the
                            surface level modality of interaction that are proposed in commodified nature.
                            Using AI in meaningful purposes requires going beyond, demystifying and
                            deconstructing.

                            Working with a collaborative artists of Yazmine , it was empirical to ensure data
                            safety, not feeing the references images of the YAZMINE EXALL into open/cloud
                            AI systems.
                            Thus ensured that both, artistic intent of Data Subject was kept secure and local,
                            as well as the work of collaborating bodies - allowing for
