            <p>Around A Memory is an interactive, web-driven installation
            exploring Internet Decay and Digital Preservation.
            The project immerses the viewers in a metaphorical
            digital environment where interactions with the installation
            trigger the rate of the enviroment’s deterioration. The
            installation encapsulates a calculated timeline of the webpage
            decay, altering the readability, positionality, and the very
            existence of HTML elements, culminating in a unsusable/empty
            HTML document.
            Aimed at creative practitioners, anthropologists, and
            digital activists, the project highlights Internet Decay by
            critically engaging with the unseen phenomena and materialising
            it through an immersive, interactive experience.
            AAM critically explores immersive web storytelling
            by deconstructing it as a dynamic, user-driven narrative
            environment (LO1). AAM examines the temporality and fragility
            of the web in the context of “Internet Decay”, highlighting the
            agency of preservation of such as a cultural artefact (L01).
            AAM pushes technical boundaries by prototyping a web-
            driven installation visualising digital decay in real-time
            (L02). User interactions with the HTML elements on the page
            act as triggers to dynamic transformation of the content/the
            deterioration process, exploring the interplay of engagement and
            decay.
            Through public discourse and prototype testing, AAM
            critically addresses the urgency of Internet Decay, positioning
            the web as both a fragile cultural artifact and an interactive
            storytelling medium (L03).

                The air is crisp, and the pavement hums with the quiet rhythm of the city waking up. Each step crunches lightly against stray leaves, and the faint scent of damp earth lingers from last night’s rain. A bus sighs at the corner, exhaling a handful of sleepy commuters. The sun is still undecided, flickering between clouds, casting shadows that stretch and dissolve. I slow my pace, letting the world drift past—shop shutters rattling open, a cyclist gliding by, the soft murmur of a distant conversation. For now, I exist between destinations, moving for the sake of movement.
            </p>

            <p>
                The dirt path twists between towering trees, their gnarled roots breaking through the soil like old bones. Sunlight filters through the dense canopy in shifting golden patterns, and the air hums with the soft trill of unseen birds. Each step disturbs a memory—leaves crunching, distant laughter, the scent of pine. An abandoned bench sits crookedly beside the path, its wood softened by time. I hesitate, tracing a hand along the worn surface. Who sat here last? What thoughts did they leave behind? The wind rustles, nudging me forward. Some places aren’t meant to be lingered in too long.
            </p>

            <p>
                Raindrops tap against my hood, a soft percussive rhythm that blends with the distant hum of traffic. The world is blurred—water streaking against streetlights, reflections stretching across wet pavement. My shoes leave faint imprints that vanish as quickly as they appear. A figure with an umbrella moves past me, faceless in the mist, footsteps fading into the quiet. I breathe in deeply—the sharp scent of rain, the earth rich and alive beneath the city’s concrete skin. Each step feels lighter, as if the rain is washing something away, leaving only the present moment behind.
            </p>

            <p>
                The sky melts into bruised oranges and deepening blues, a slow-motion exhale of the day. Streetlights flicker on one by one, casting pools of warm light on the empty sidewalk. I pass a row of shuttered storefronts, their neon signs still humming faintly, as if reluctant to let go of the day. The distant sound of laughter drifts from an open window, mixing with the rhythmic click of my footsteps. I could turn back, retrace my steps, return to where I started—but the road ahead is painted in fading light, and for now, I keep walking.
