                <p> Around A Memory is an interactive, web-driven installation
                    exploring Internet Decay and Digital Preservation.
                    The project immerses the viewers in a metaphorical
                    digital environment where interactions with the installation
                    trigger the rate of the enviroment’s deterioration. The
                    installation encapsulates a calculated timeline of the webpage
                    decay, altering the readability, positionality, and the very
                    existence of HTML elements, culminating in a unsusable/empty
                    HTML document.
                    Aimed at creative practitioners, anthropologists, and
                    digital activists, the project highlights Internet Decay by
                    critically engaging with the unseen phenomena and materialising
                    it through an immersive, interactive experience.</p>

            <p>Today we to talk about the <span id="walk">walk</span>. Suburban upbringing does not come without the sense of privilege for the ability to take a moment from the problems in <span id="urban">urban hymns</span> and not the one which Velvet Underground sang about, but more son of the ones that are present in the Metal Machine. The constant clattering, noice and essentially the main polluter ie the human.</p>
            <p>Growing up the simple pleasure of finding the so-called peace within the park/nature or whatever we chose to call it was an <span id="escape">escape</span>. Closing a loop, the city <span id="expands">expands</span>, replacing the bark trees with concrete ones. Although the problems in urban living are not for what this piece is wrote for - today we talk about ambience.</p>
            <p>Years later, when the hedonistic desire for the <span id="ambience">ambience</span> turned into a formed habit, the absence and presence of the feeling becomes so apparent and obvious. You start looking for that same sense not just in the physical manifestations, but far more beyond. You learn to cherish that feeling, you start to see it in the places where perhaps it <span id="is">is</span> not to be <span id="seen">seen</span>.</p>
            <p>And then there’s the <span id="web">web</span> — vast, silent, <span id="fragile">fragile</span>. Once built for information, now cluttered with noise. But between the static and the scroll, there are still shadows of something slower. Interfaces that breathe. A hyperlink, like a path. A webpage, like a memory. The walk doesn’t end at the screen — it refracts through it.
                This is a trace of that walk.</p>

            <p class="paragraph decay">Not quite stillness, but a looseness—like time hasn’t fully begun yet.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">The city is tentative, unsure whether to remain quiet or ramp into noise.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">I feel like a ghost inside it.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">Light pools in unexpected places: between car mirrors, under benches, behind the thin veil of my breath.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">Someone across the street laughs into their phone, but the sound barely reaches me, like I’m under water.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">I trace the edge of a crack in the sidewalk with my shoe, waiting for nothing in particular.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">Everything seems paused, held in place by a thread of morning softness.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">The digital world hasn’t caught up yet—no pings, no messages, no demands.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">Just motion for the sake of remembering what it feels like to walk, to notice.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">A city breathing in.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">And maybe, for a moment, I’m allowed to breathe with it.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph decay">The scent of warm plastic and distant coffee machines lingers.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">Nothing is urgent, but something is quietly ending.</p>

            <p class="paragraph decay">My shoes leave faint imprints that vanish as quickly as they appear.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">A figure with an umbrella moves past me, faceless in the mist, footsteps fading into the quiet.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">I breathe in deeply—the sharp scent of rain, the earth rich and alive beneath the city’s concrete skin.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">Each step feels lighter, as if the rain is washing something away, leaving only the present moment behind.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph decay">The sky melts into bruised oranges and deepening blues, a slow-motion exhale of the day.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">Streetlights flicker on one by one, casting pools of warm light on the empty sidewalk.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">I pass a row of shuttered storefronts, their neon signs still humming faintly, as if reluctant to let go of the day.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">The distant sound of laughter drifts from an open window, mixing with the rhythmic click of my footsteps.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay">I could turn back, retrace my steps, return to where I started—but the road ahead is painted in fading light, and for now, I keep walking.</p>

            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">What thoughts did they leave behind?</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">The wind rustles, nudging me forward.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">Some places aren’t meant to be lingered in too long.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">Raindrops tap against my hood, a soft percussive rhythm that blends with the distant hum of traffic.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">The world is blurred—water streaking against streetlights, reflections stretching across wet pavement.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">My shoes leave faint imprints that vanish as quickly as they appear.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">A figure with an umbrella moves past me, faceless in the mist, footsteps fading into the quiet.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">I breathe in deeply—the sharp scent of rain, the earth rich and alive beneath the city’s concrete skin.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">Each step feels lighter, as if the rain is washing something away, leaving only the present moment behind.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">The sky melts into bruised oranges and deepening blues, a slow-motion exhale of the day.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">Streetlights flicker on one by one, casting pools of warm light on the empty sidewalk.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">I pass a row of shuttered storefronts, their neon signs still humming faintly, as if reluctant to let go of the day.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">The distant sound of laughter drifts from an open window, mixing with the rhythmic click of my footsteps.</p>
            <p class="paragraph decay ero2">I could turn back, retrace my steps, return to where I started—but the road ahead is painted in fading light, and for now, I keep walking.</p>
